Tilt Billings saw a guitar in a pawn shop window
Not much to look at but he knew that he'd found
That old student Prince that they made years ago
So easy to play, what unbeatable sound

Paid twenty bucks and grabbed his guitar
Still be a steal at ten times the dough
It was amazing how a mere beginner
Could play just a few notes and sound like a pro

He'd play his heart out when he was at parties
Guys would get jealous but girls were impressed
They'd ask how he did it? He'd say
"Nothin' to it, with this kind of guitar it brings out my best"

One night when he had the room captivated
He took five and set down his prince
When a drunk stumbled by and sat down where he laid it
And he's never sounded quite the same since

So Tilt's still upset but he's givin' up crying
Just can't lift his eyes from the sad, sad ground
Time marches on with its fingers still trying
To find, once again, that student Prince sound
