C'mon little child just sitting there
C'mon down to the county fair
Out on the highest peaks
Where we can speak our piece
Up on the ferris wheel
We can make a nice round deal

Out on the Tilt-A-Whirl
You will be my little girl

C'mon away with me and
Spend another day with me
And we can run around
The kind of place that love is found
It's all for you and me
To burn up in ecstacy

Out on the Tilt-A-Whirl
You will be my little girl

Hey babe my fire
My heart's on fire
Hey babe my fire
My heart's on fire

Out on the Tilt-A-Whirl
You will be my little girl

C'mon child just sitting there
C'mon down to the count
