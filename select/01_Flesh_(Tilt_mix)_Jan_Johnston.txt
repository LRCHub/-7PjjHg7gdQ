Ahhh. baby, i can hardly recognize myself
Mmmmmmmm... touch me

The light is going blue.
Morning approaches.
The pain's still here.
I'm empty - empty - empty.

Sounds of the world,
Of laughter and tears.
I've nothing left.
I'm empty - empty - empty.

Heaven is forbidden
But I'm going soon
Kiss me one last time
Before i take my flesh away
Heaven is forbidden
But I'm going soon
Kiss me one last time
Kiss me one last time

I want wisdom on tap, flowing like water
Strange i want that because
I'm empty - empty - empty.

So now eat your words,
I hope you choke.
I feel nothing no more.
I'm empty - empty - empty.

Ahhh. baby, i can hardly recognize myself
Mmmmmmmm... touch me

Heaven is forbidden
But I'm going soon
Kiss me one last time
Before i take my flesh away
Heaven is forbidden
But I'm going soon
Kiss me one last time
Kiss me one last time
